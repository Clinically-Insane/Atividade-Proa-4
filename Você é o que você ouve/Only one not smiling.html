<h1>Clap along, clap along
<br>He skipped to be the next big thing
<br>But why do I feel like I'm watching an advert every time he sings?
<br>Fair enough, fair enough
<br>Everyone's trying to make a living
<br>Everybody needs to make a deal with
<br>Diet coke to keep all the plates spinning
<br>Am I the only one not smiling in this place?
<br>"Sale now, on sale now! On..."
<br>"The big discounts of the year!"
<br>The crowds outside the store are bigger than a Hollywood premier
<br>And I've seen, I've seen two sets of punches thrown
<br>The first for an HD TV, the second for a phone
<br>Am I the only one not smiling in this place?
<br>What's this, what's this? Is it 1955?
<br>He says she's asking for trouble with that dress that shows her thighs
<br>Now, with a bottle of wine, bottle of wine
<br>Oh, I see him making a move
<br>Than I hear him call her freaky just because she refused
<br>She's the only one not smiling in this place
<br>Drink up, drink up, I really want to leave
<br>Those red-faced men in here are shouting stuff wouldn't believe
<br>Anyone, anyone, who's not what they know
<br>Is a direct threat that might infect that status quo
<br>And they're the only ones not smiling in this place
<br>Time out, time out! I wanna get-a this right
<br>I've been to the top three times and three times I though I'd died
<br>Can I opt out, opt out? It's too fast for me
<br>You may wanna see the world as a blur but I would rather sightsee
<br>How will this madness ever reign?
<br>Are we the only ones still smiling in this place?
<br>What do you know, what do you know?
<br>Here I feel just fine
<br>I'm not waiting sun and face to hear something out of line
<br>What do we do, what do we do?
<br>I know it might sound strange
<br>But I can feel a turning point if you can see a change
<br>What do you know, what do you know?
<br>Here I feel just fine
<br>I'm not waiting sun and face to hear something out of line
<br>What do we do, what do we do?
<br>I know it might sound strange
<br>But I can feel a turning point if you can see a change
