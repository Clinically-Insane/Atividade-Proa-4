<h1>I've fallen off the train again
<br>I'm falling on insane
<br>While waiting for the world to turn
<br>Watching me disappear -
<br>Me? I'm outta here
<br>I appreciate your faint concern
<br>Oh, we're all crazy, we're all mad!
<br>A thimbleful of sanity is all we ever had!
<br>Arsenic or everclear -
<br>Pick your poison, fast my dear!
<br>The apocalypse is drawing near
<br>And we're all gonna die
<br>I've fallen off the wagon, dear
<br>I landed on my head, I fear
<br>My wits are scattered hither and yon
<br>Like Humpty-Dumpty I'm a wreck
<br>I broke my rubber chicken neck
<br>And on my face I fell, a lot
<br>Oh we're all crazy, we're all mad
<br>A thimbleful of sanity is all we ever had!
<br>Arsenic or everclear -
<br>Pick your poison fast, my dear!
<br>Cause the apocalypse is drawing near
<br>And we're all gonna die!
<br>The sky is caving in on me
<br>And black is all that I can see
<br>My hand has disappeared into the night
<br>"Nevermore," the raven said
<br>And then he fell upon his head
<br>The poor bird lost his
<br>Balance in his flight!
<br>Oh we're all crazy, we're all mad
<br>A thimbleful of sanity is all we ever had!
<br>Arsenic or everclear -
<br>Pick your poison fast, my dear!
<br>Cause the apocalypse is drawing near
<br>And we're all gonna die!
<br>(Here we go!)
